Hello, my name is Joshua Osborne and this is my About Me Project. The purpose of this project is to get familiar with coding and using Vs code. In the beggining we learned everything from adding HTML, links and images,
to cascading style sheets, getting familiar with flexbox and grid, and using interface elements like tables, forms and buttons.
